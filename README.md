# out-front

A service that monitors pending transactions for unauthorized transfers of ERC20 tokens from wallets and fires off a competing transaction at a higher gas price to divert funds into a rescue wallet. The system is non-custodial and uses a signed (EIP712) permission token to execute recovery

## origin

## current status

The project is currently a working POC.

Running the project requires API keys for [Blocknative](https://blocknative.com) and/or [Radar Deploy](https://deploy.radar.tech). But it can be set up to use a personal geth node.

## goals

We plan to add documentation on how this works and how to run the code yourself.

# usage

Coming soon...
