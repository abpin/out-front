# out-front

A nodejs app for interacting with the Ethereum chain.

## concept

A system for continual monitoring of addresses for non-whitelisted txs. Upon detecting an in-flight funds transfer, a user-created package is released, attempting to supersede the malicious actors and transfer your assets to safety.

## origin

This was built during the [EthDenver](https://ethdenver.com) 2020 hackathon.

## current status

The project is currently a working POC.

Running the project requires API keys for [Blocknative](https://blocknative.com) and [Radarr](https://radar.tech).

## goals

We plan to add documentation on how this works and how to run the code yourself.

# usage

Coming soon...
